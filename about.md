I'm **Rijuta Ghosh**, a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about **cybersecurity**, especially the **blue teaming side** — defending systems, understanding threats, and staying a few steps ahead of attackers.

### More Information

## Why I Started This Blog

I realized that writing about what I learn helps me understand it better — and maybe, just maybe, it helps someone else who’s also starting out. I’ll be posting updates, short explainers, and thoughts as I grow in this field.

## Outside of Tech?

I'm curious by nature. I love learning, designing visual things, and sometimes editing videos. I’m also a little introverted but super observant. You’ll probably see all of that reflect in how I explain things here 😉

## Let's Connect

If you're also learning cybersecurity or exploring tech in any way, feel free to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE) — I’d love to learn and grow with like-minded people.

Stay curious 🔐
