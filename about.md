I'm **Rijuta Ghosh**, a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about **cybersecurity**, especially the **blue teaming side** — defending systems, understanding threats, and staying a few steps ahead of attackers.

## Why I Started This Blog

I realized that writing about what I learn helps me understand it better — and maybe, just maybe, it helps someone else who’s also starting out. I’ll be posting updates, short explainers, and thoughts as I grow in this field.

## Outside of Tech?

I’m someone who genuinely loves to explore different things — not because I’m great at all of them, but because I believe **knowledge never goes to waste**.

Here are a few things that make me, *me*:

- 🎤 I love to sing — I’ve shared some of my singing reels on my [riju.ta_](https://instagram.com/riju.ta_)
- 🖌️ I paint using **gouache**, especially when I want to relax and express emotions
- 🧠 I enjoy learning just about anything that sparks my interest — whether it’s psychology, tech, art, or human behavior
- 💻 I code too — as a **BTech CSE 2nd-year student**, I'm currently building Java projects and will soon be diving into **C++** this semester
- 💬 I run an [_cheshire.cat_15](https://instagram.com/_cheshire.cat_15) where I share **lessons I've learned, motivational thoughts**, and personal reflections — mostly shaped by my own mistakes and growth

I may not be the best at any one thing, but I’m proud to love many things — and that’s how I stay inspired 🌻
