Hey everyone 👋,

Welcome to my very first blog post!

I'm Rijuta, a computer science undergrad who's deeply interested in cybersecurity — especially the defensive side (blue teaming). I’ve decided to use this space to document my learning journey as I grow, explore, and level up in the field. Whether it's networking fundamentals, cybersecurity certifications, or personal projects — you’ll find it all here.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Right Now

I’m currently enrolled in the **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** course by the **University of London** on Coursera. I'm about halfway through it. It’s a solid course that covers the big-picture ideas in security — from threats and vulnerabilities to key principles like confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

But after a point, I felt a bit saturated and needed a change of pace — so I switched gears to sharpen my **networking fundamentals**, which is a foundational pillar in cybersecurity.

## 🌐 Networking Focus: Preparing for CompTIA Network+

To build stronger fundamentals, I started preparing for **CompTIA Network+**, using videos from **Professor Messer**'s YouTube series. It's helping me understand how real-world networks operate and how attackers can exploit them — which is crucial for both blue and red teaming.

So far, I’ve completed:
- ✅ OSI Model  
- ✅ Networking Devices  
- ✅ Wireless Networks
- ✅ QoS (Quality of Service)  
- ✅ Cloud Design & Deployment Models  

Right now, I’m diving into the **Introduction to IP** section. Excited to finally understand IP addressing properly — it's a topic I’ve always wanted to master!

## 💻 Side Project: Password Strength Analyzer (Java)

In parallel, I’m building a small Java project: a **Password Strength Analyzer**. It checks how strong a password is based on different criteria like length, character variety, and entropy.

It's basic for now, but I'm using it to practice core Java concepts like classes, methods, and GUI elements — and eventually, I might integrate a bit of cybersecurity logic into it, like password hashing or breach-checking.

## 🎯 What’s Next?

Over the coming weeks, I’ll:
- Finish the Coursera course  
- Continue working through Network+ topics  
- Build more mini-projects  
- And… maybe try writing short explanations of what I learn!

Thanks for stopping by! If you're also learning cybersecurity or working toward Network+, feel free to connect — I'd love to learn together 🤝

Stay curious 🔐
